        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Installing arch is definitely a task and there will most likely be complications. Almost every situation seems to be a few good google searches away. </p>
        <h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Screenshots are taken periodically but not at every single minor step. </li>
        <li>I highly recommend vmware pro as it streamlines the snapshot process.</li>
        <li>Additionally I attempted to verify the initial arch download but was unsuccessful after an hour and a half of attempts and will skip through that step although its highly advised. <h2 id="acquire-an-installation-image">Acquire an installation image</h2>

        <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/">https://archlinux.org/download/</a>
        Scroll to United States - mit.edu
        Click <a href="https://mirrors.mit.edu/archlinux/iso/2024.10.01/archlinux-2024.10.01-x86_64.iso">archlinux-2024.10.01-x86_64.iso</a>
        Additionally download the sig file for the next step

        </ul>
        <h2 id="1-4-boot-the-live-environment">1.4 Boot the live environment</h2>
        <p>Using VMWare Workstation Pro 17.1
        Go to VMWare and hit Create a New Virtual Machine 
            -&gt;Installer disc image file (iso):
            -&gt;Browse.. Downloads/archlinux-2024.10.01-x86_64
            -&gt;Open
        Go through the wizard and hit finish
        Run the VM by double clicking it </p>
        <h2 id="set-the-console-keyboard-layout-and-font">Set the console keyboard layout and font</h2>
        <p>Changed to a much more readable font using:
        setfont ter-132n
        Looks way better in my opinion 
        ![[Pasted image 20241023180920.png]]</p>
        <h2 id="very-the-boot-mode">Very the boot mode</h2>
        <p>Use the command: cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size
        I got the result  64 which is good for my machine
        ![[Pasted image 20241023181006.png]]</p>
        <h2 id="connect-to-the-internet">Connect to the internet</h2>
        <p>Network connection was working as expected
        ![[Pasted image 20241023181451.png]]</p>
        <h2 id="update-the-system-clock">Update the system clock</h2>
        <p>Use the command:
        timedatectl

        <h2 id="1-9-partition-the-disks">1.9 Partition the disks</h2>
        <p>7:46 PM 10/23/2024
        Start commands : 
        fdisk /dev/(your_drive)
        g (create GTI partition table)
        n (new partition)
        [enter] (1st partition default)
        [enter] (auto starting)
        +550M (550 megabytes)</p>
        <p>ditto although instead of 550M do +2G
        then same do [enter] instead of +2G
        t -&gt;1 -&gt;1
        t-&gt;2-&gt;19
        (the third partition is already correct)
        w (writes table)</p>
        <h2 id="mounting-the-filesystem-and-downloading-kde-plasma">Mounting the filesystem and downloading KDE Plasma</h2>
        <p>Doing this was pretty simple as it was just a few commands for mounting
        Downloading Plasma took a youtube video but I had problems when getting into the desktop
        After messing with enabling things for an hour or two the fix was creating a new user
        Signing into this user made everything run smoothly</p>
